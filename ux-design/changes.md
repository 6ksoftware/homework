**Problem: 

Prior to the 2016 Presidential elections, I found an issue regarding how Americans received information about the government. To better understand the issue: such topics concerning all things government and congress came from a source, which was then written about by a news outlet, and finally released to the public. Although the general public was capable of locating the information direct from the source themselves, the true issue lied in that this information was not in one location. Rather, it was sporadic across the web, and therefore didnâ€™t provide for a great user experience.

**Solution: 

My solution was simple: create an easy-to-use application where users can follow and track information that comes straight from the source, while also giving them a voice. 

All the information about congress including Legislators, Bills, Voting Records and Committees are all available on websites like Congress.gov, Senate.gov, and House.gov - but it is not easy to access or readily available in one place. This is where FedCaddy comes in; providing access to all 535 members of congress, every bill and every committee. Also, as a constituent, users are given the opportunity to vote on bills that their local representative or state senator will vote on in the future. This feature, along with others, will provide for a better user experience when trying to keep track of the government.

**Design Process: How I approach each design challenge for a website or mobile application from scratch

App Concept-
My design process in building the app began with the app concept. I define the problem and then address it with the value proposition: ex. This is FedCaddy-"Stay connected with what's going on in your government"

User Persona-
This portion would address the behaviors of our typical users as well as their needs and goals.

Wireframes-
I move on to low fidelity wireframes on paper or on sticky notes, providing an idea of the key features that will be a part of the application.

Moodboard/Style Tile/Language Visuals-
Here I discover why a user would use this application and how to communicate the mood through colors, shapes, gestures/movement, etc.

Prototype-
Finally, the prototyping stage where I create the application in sketch and prototype in your favorite prototyping software :) I usually either use Zeplin or Invision

Style Guide-
Lastly, I create a style guide which shows various information such as the typography used, as well as color palette and other elements of the user interface.
